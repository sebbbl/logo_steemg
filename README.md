[Communication with task author](https://busy.org/@sebbbl/re-dapeng-steemg-logo-20180617t191834337z)

#### Details
When I first read the task request, the logo shape was so obvious in my mind that I immediately started to work on Inkscape.

The logo represents a G in a hexagon. A large contour is used, filled with a dark gray to light gray gradient.

The text "steemg" is written in white in the horizontal bar of the G. As asked by the author, a version without text is also provided for small size icons which would made the text too small to be read.

#### Benefits / Improvements
This logo is very simple and quickly identifiable. It respects the main colours of the website as asked in the task request. It is also easily identifiable when used as a favicon, as it can be seen above.
