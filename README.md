# logo_steemg

#### Repository
https://github.com/pzhaonet/steemg

#### Linked Task Request
https://steemit.com/utopian-io/@dapeng/steemg-logo

#### Details
When I first read the task request, the logo shape was so obvious in my mind that I immediately started to work on Inkscape.

The logo represents a G in a hexagon. A large contour is used, filled with a gradient.

The text "steemg" is written in white in the horizontal bar of the G. As asked by the author, a version without text is also provided for small size icons which would made the text to small to be read.

#### Benefits / Improvements
This logo is very simple and quickly identifiable. It respects the main colours of the website. It is also easily identifiable when used as a favicon.
